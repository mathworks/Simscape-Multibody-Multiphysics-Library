%% Adding Actuators to CAD Model of a Lift Table
%
% This example shows how to extend CAD models with physical effects in
% Simscape Multibody.  A CAD model of a lift table is imported into
% Simscape.  Simulations are used to determine the amount of force or
% torque an actuator would need to provide to lift the table.  Simscape
% models of a hydraulic cylinder and an electric lead screw are added to
% the model to see how the system behaves.
%
% Simscape enables you to determine high-level actuator requirements, such
% as the amount of force, torque, or power an actuator must provide.
% Different actuation technologies can be connected to the 3-D mechanical
% model to see which actuators would be an option in the final design

%% CAD Model of Lift Table
%
% The mechanical design of the lift table was created in Onshape

%% Lift Table Model Imported from CAD
%
% CAD models can be imported from various CAD environments.  For Onshape
% models, use the command smexportonshape().  The model below shows what
% the raw imported model looks like.

%% Lift Table Model With No Actuation
%
% Once imported, you can group parts and joints within subsystems to make
% the the block diagram easier to read.  Here, we can see the prismatic
% joint representing the degree of freedom that we need to actuate.

% <matlab:open_system('sm_lift_table_1_arch'); Open Model>

%% Hydraulic Actuator: Determine Required Force
%
% To determine the force that is required to lift the table, we can
% prescribe the motion of the prismatic joint and the simulation will
% calculate how much force is needed to produce that motion. 
%
% <matlab:open_system('sm_lift_table_f1_actf'); Open Model>

%% Hydraulic Actuator: Test Design
%
% A hydraulic actuator is connected to our mechanical model. The input
% signal to the valve adjusts the spool position which controls flow to and
% from the hydraulic actuator.  The actuator extends and contracts to raise
% and lower the table.  This model allows us to determine the size of the
% hydraulic cylinder and the required pressures and flow rates in our
% system.

%% Electric Actuator: Determine Required Torque
%
% A leadscrew driven by an electric motor is a second method of actuation
% considered for our design.  Replacing the prismatic joint with a lead
% screw and a revolute joint gives us an additional degree of freedom. We
% specify the rate of extension for the leadscrew, and measure the required
% torque to produce that motion at the revolute joint that was added.  With
% this information, we can determine the size of our motor.

%% Electric Actuator: Test Design
%
% An electromechanical actuator is connected to our mechanical model. The
% electric motor spins the screw forward and backward to extend and
% contract the actuator which raises and lowers the lift table.  Hard stops
% have been added to limit the extension of our actuator.  This model
% allows us to select gear ratios and determine the power requirements of
% our motor.
