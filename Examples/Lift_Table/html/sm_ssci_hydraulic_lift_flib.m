%% Hydraulic Actuator with 1D Mechanical Ports
% 
% This example shows how to extend Simscape Multibody models with
% additional physical effects using only the Foundation library blocks in
% Simscape. A hydraulic actuator raises and lowers a lift table by extending and
% contracting.  The table is a four-bar mechanism which moves vertically
% and horizontally.
%
% This method of extending Simscape Multibody models does not communicate
% the position information from the Simscape Multibody joints to the
% Simscape mechanical blocks. Some Simscape blocks, such as the hardstop,
% require that information. When using this method, you can use MATLAB
% variables to set consistent initial positions in the joint and hardstop
% block.  
% 
% Another way to set the value is to update diagram (Ctrl+D), read the
% initial position from the Model Report in the Mechanics Explorer (Tools
% --> Model Report), and then use that value into the hard stop block
% parameter.  In this example, we set the hard stop initial position using
% value from the Model Explorer.  To test this method, click on the
% hyperlink to change the initial height of the table, update diagram, get
% the initial position of the Prismatic Cylinder Piston, and enter that
% into the mask of the Hydraulic Actuator.

%% Hydraulic Actuator Subsystem
%
% This hydraulic actuator is constructed using Simscape Foundation library
% blocks.  More advanced components are available in Simscape Fluids.  In
% this network, the hardstop block needs to know the initial position of
% the Simscape Multibody joint to which it is connected.  That value is set
% in the mask for this subsystem.

%% Four Bar Subsystem
%
% This models the lift table as a four-bar mechanism.  The initial height
% of the table is set using the position state target for the Y-prismatic
% degree of freedom in the 6-DOF Joint labeled Initial Table Height.  That
% value is set in the mask for this subsystem.
%
% The 6-DOF Joint has no effect on the dynamics or kinematics during
% simulation.  It is only used to set the initial position of the mechanism
% along an axis where we have not defined a joint.

%% Simulation Results from Simscape Logging
%
% The table is lifted and lowered in stages.  The upper and lower limits on
% the cylinder extension indicates that the cylinder has reached the ends
% of its range of travel.
